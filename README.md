# Blog Design Assignment

For this assignment you are given a marked HTML blog file. You will write CSS to style the HTML. You may add CSS classes to the HTML document if you wish. Please take note of the content... Who is the audience? What is the tone? Your design should reflect this. While this is primarily a typography assignment, you may also add some borders, backgrounds and use color where appropriate. As the designer, those are your choices to make. Use the resources below to help you. As always, reach out to me if you have questions or need help. Please survey editorial content on the web to get some ideas.
